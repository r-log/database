        -- `By Blood and Ash` (14218) asks for 80 Bloodfang Stalker (35229) kills made
        -- with the Rebel Cannons on Tobias Mistmantle's hill. The cannons could not be
        -- clicked, so the quest was unfinishable. Everything except one row was already
        -- in place; this adds the row.
        --
        -- What was already right, checked rather than assumed:
        --   * 35317 is a creature-vehicle, `VehicleTemplateId` 470. Vehicle.dbc 470
        --     carries a single seat, 5206, flags 0x62100803 = CAN_CONTROL | CAN_CAST |
        --     CAN_EXIT | NOT_SELECTABLE | ALLOW_TURNING. One seat means no
        --     `vehicle_accessory` row is wanted, and CAN_CAST is what hands the player
        --     the cannon's action bar.
        --   * `creature_template_spells` already lists 67279 as the cannon's spell 1.
        --     67279 fires a TRIGGER_MISSILE of 67278, which is a 15 yd knock-back plus
        --     412 school damage - a one-shot against a 102 hp stalker.
        --   * Our 14 cannon spawns (219596-219605, 219991-219993, 220555) are the same
        --     14 the retail capture shows, position for position to three decimals,
        --     e.g. ours (-1549.4, 1595.7, 26.5) against retail (-1549.410, 1595.730,
        --     26.536). Nothing to add or move.
        --
        -- The capture settles the boarding chain exactly. At t=3045.03 the client sends
        -- a selection and an interact packet both carrying the cannon's guid; at
        -- t=3045.70 spell **43671 `Ride Vehicle`** casts, and one tick later its
        -- CONTROL_VEHICLE aura (effect 0, aura 236) lands on the cannon while the
        -- dummy on effect 1 lands on the player. `Ride Vehicle Hardcoded` (46598)
        -- never appears - the chain is click -> 43671, nothing else. At t=3047.01 the
        -- cannon's charmer becomes the player and its faction flips to the player's.
        --
        -- `cast_flags` 1 makes the player the caster and the cannon the target, which
        -- is what SpellHandler.cpp does with the flag and the shape our own horse row
        -- (44427, 67001, ...) has been running on since Rel22_07_056.
        --
        -- Gated on the quest being in the log, which is what TrinityCore expresses as
        -- condition (18, 35317, 43671, 9, 14218) and what m3 expresses natively with
        -- quest_start + quest_start_active. `quest_end` = the same quest retires the
        -- click once it is handed in.
        --
        -- No script, no `spell_script_target` and no core change are needed:
        --   * 67278's second target is a plain hostile area fill, not the
        --     TARGET_AREAEFFECT_CUSTOM that made the Sacrifices torch burn its own
        --     horse, and the manned cannon wears the player's faction anyway.
        --   * The client, not the server, aims the shot - the capture shows CMSG
        --     0x00E8 carrying an explicit destination triple that SMSG_SPELL_START
        --     echoes back byte for byte, so m3's TARGET_DIRECTLY_FORWARD random-range
        --     path is never entered.
        --   * Rel22_07_058's sparring floor on 35229 does not block the kills.
        --     `Unit::IsSparringWith` exempts any attacker that resolves to a player,
        --     and boarding sets the cannon's charmer to the player.
        --   * `Vehicle.cpp` already calls `ClearTemporaryFaction()` on unboard, so a
        --     used cannon returns to faction 35 and stays clickable for the next run.
