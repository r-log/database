-- The HealthMultiplier values here are DOCUMENTARY on this core: every

-- NULL and SelectLevel never reads the multiplier, falling back to
-- MinLevelHealth. They record what retail broadcasts, and would take
-- effect if these creatures ever gain classlevelstats rows. The health
-- that actually bites comes from the MinLevelHealth migrations.
