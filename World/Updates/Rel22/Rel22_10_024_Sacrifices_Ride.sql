        --     +0.00s  67001 `Summon Crowley's Horse` -> 46598; the player is seated
        --     +4.15s  the horse lands at (-1714.76, 1673.16, 20.49)   [jump 1]
        --     +9.48s  67063 `Throw Torch`, the first of many

        --     +37.5s  it leaves the path at (-1592.10, 1710.71)
        --     +39.6s  it lands at (-1566.71, 1708.04, 20.49)          [jump 2]
        --     +79.5s  51254 `Dan's Eject All Passengers`; the player is on the ground

        -- server-side for the entire ride and driven by splines - the player holds the

        -- 1. THE HORSE WAS KILLING ITSELF WITH THE TORCH.
        --
        --    67063 `Throw Torch` resolves through TARGET_AREAEFFECT_CUSTOM, and

        --    thrown from. The log is unambiguous:
        --        PeriodicTick: Vehicle (Entry: 35231) attacked Vehicle (Entry: 35231)
        --                      for 42 dmg inflicted by 67063

        --    duration, and CREATURE_FLAG_EXTRA_UNKILLABLE does not save it, because
        --    the clamp in `Unit.cpp` is written `damage >= health && pVictim != this`

        --    street mid-route, and the accessory Crowley despawned five seconds later,
        --    which is the corpse line that made it look like Crowley had died.

        --    alone; ours has 31 spawns of 51277 - the same `Bloodfang Stalker` under a
